# Firmware for the NUCLEO-F401RE board

The code in this directory is graciously provided by Tomasz WÅ‚ostowski. He
developed it in the context of another flywheel project (based on a brushless DC
motor he scraped off a hard drive). I adapted it slightly to work on my
home-made motor, notably adjusting the proportional gain in the PI controller
and working on the sequencing of the phases to be able to turn my flywheel both
clockwise and anticlockwise. In any case, the heavy lifting was done by Tom, so
kudos to him.
