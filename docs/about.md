My name is Adrian Serrano Capatina, and I am a student at the International School of Geneva. This project is part of my Travail de Maturité, which is the final long project of the [matura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matura) curriculum. It is a 4000 word essay in which I chose to explore the differences, advantages and disadvantages of mechanical batteries and flywheel batteries specifically when compared to lithium-ion batteries.

This project was made possible by contributions from Tomasz Włostowski, Javier Serrano Pareja and Ofelia Capatina.
