Many renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, are intermittent. It is
therefore important to be able to store energy cleanly so that it can be used
when it's needed. In flywheel energy storage systems, surplus energy is stored
in the form of the (rotating) kinetic energy of a high-inertia object called a
flywheel. No chemicals are involved, which makes them very friendly to the
environment. In addition, wear out is minimal. On the down side, these systems
are difficult to transport and the stored energy is gradually lost as heat due
to the friction between the rotating part (rotor) and the static part (stator)
of the system.

This project explores flywheel energy storage systems through the development of
a prototype aimed at minimizing friction. I designed a motor with no mechanical
bearings. The contact of the rotor with the outside world is limited to the very
sharp tip of a metallic rod. The rest of the alignment is made with the help of
magnets, therefore avoiding any physical contact.

The video below gives you an idea of what the system looks like when in action.
You will find more in-depth information in the rest of the site.
