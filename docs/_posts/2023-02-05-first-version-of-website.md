Phew, this was quite a lot of work in the end! The first version of the website
is ready. I have learned (am learning) a lot during the development of this
project, often thanks to people who put their knowledge out there for everybody
to use as they wish. I wanted to give back a little bit, so here's my
contribution.

Jekyll has made it very easy to make the website, and its seamless integration
with GitHub (and free hosting) is certainly a bonus. Enjoy!
